> 此文虽然有了多个中文版本，还是想重新翻译一次，算是精读。

今天是我的生日。我已经 70 岁了。到目前为止，我学到了一些可能对其他人有帮助的东西。在过去的几年里，我每年都会记下一些不请自来的建议，令我惊讶的是，今年我还有更多要补充的东西。所以这是我给大家的生日礼物：103 条我希望我年轻时就知道的人生智慧。
## 1-10
• About 99% of the time, the right time is right now.
>大约99%的时候，最佳时机就是现在。

• No one is as impressed with your possessions as you are.
>没有人像你一样对你的资产印象深刻。

• Dont ever work for someone you dont want to become.
> 永远不要为你不想成为的人工作。

• Cultivate 12 people who love you, because they are worth more than 12 million people who like you.
> 用心滋养12个爱你的人，因为他们比1200万喜欢你的人更有价值。

• Dont keep making the same mistakes; try to make new mistakes.
> 不要一直犯同样的错误；尝试犯些新的错误。

• If you stop to listen to a musician or street performer for more than a minute, you owe them a dollar.
> 如果你停下来听一个音乐家或街头艺人表演超过一分钟，你就欠他们一美元.

• Anything you say before the word “but” does not count.
> 你在“但是”这个词之前说的任何话都不算数。

• When you forgive others, they may not notice, but you will heal. Forgiveness is not something we do for others; it is a gift to ourselves.
> 当宽恕他人时，对方可能不会注意到，但你会被治愈。宽恕不是我们为他人做的事；而是给自己的礼物。

• Courtesy costs nothing. Lower the toilet seat after use. Let the people in the elevator exit before you enter. Return shopping carts to their designated areas. When you borrow something, return it better shape (filled up, cleaned) than when you got it.
> 体面并不需要花钱：（男士）如厕后放下马桶圈；让电梯里的人先出来，你再进去；把购物车放回指定区域；当你借东西的时候，归还的时候要比你得到的时候更好（填满，更清洁）。

• Whenever there is an argument between two sides, find the third side.
> 每当发生两个观点的争执时，找到第三种观点。

## 11-20
• Efficiency is highly overrated; Goofing off is highly underrated. Regularly scheduled sabbaths, sabbaticals, vacations, breaks, aimless walks and time off are essential for top performance of any kind. The best work ethic requires a good rest ethic.
> 高效被过度强调了，而无所事事放空休闲的重要性则被严重低估了。定期的周日安息、职业年假、度假出游、工作日中的茶歇、漫无目的的散步和远离工作的时间，对任何领域想获得顶级成就都极其重要。最好的职业道德要求良好的休息道德。

• When you lead, your real job is to create more leaders, not more followers.
> 真正的领导力，是塑造更多的领导者，而不是更多的追随者.

• Criticize in private, praise in public.
> 批评人要在私下，表扬人要尽可能公开。

• Life lessons will be presented to you in the order they are needed. Everything you need to master the lesson is within you. Once you have truly learned a lesson, you will be presented with the next one. If you are alive, that means you still have lessons to learn.
> 人生功课会按照你需要的顺序到来。而且你已经掌握精通此门功课所需要的一切。一旦你真正掌握了一门功课，你就会得到下一个。只要生命在继续，那也意味着持续的功课.

• It is the duty of a student to get everything out of a teacher, and the duty of a teacher to get everything out of a student.
> 从老师那里学到一切是学生的责任，充分激发学生的潜能也是老师的责任

• If winning becomes too important in a game, change the rules to make it more fun. Changing rules can become the new game.
> 在一场比赛中如果输赢变得太过重要，就应该改变规则，使其变得更加有趣。改变规则后可以成为新的游戏。

• Ask funders for money, and they’ll give you advice; but ask for advice and they’ll give you money.
> 向投资人筹款，他们会给你建议；但向他们咨询建议，他们会给你金钱。

• Productivity is often a distraction. Don’t aim for better ways to get through your tasks as quickly as possible, rather aim for better tasks that you never want to stop doing.
> 对效率的追求往往会分散注意力。不要总想着寻找可以快速完成任务的方法，而应该寻找你永远不想停下手的任务。

• Immediately pay what you owe to vendors, workers, contractors. They will go out of their way to work with you first next time.
> 立即支付您欠供应商、工人、承包商的款项。下次他们会不遗余力地与您合作，像第一次合作一样。

• The biggest lie we tell ourselves is “I dont need to write this down because I will remember it.”
> 我们对自己撒的最大谎言是 "这不需要写下来，我能记得住"。

## 21-30

> 作为一个有意识的人，你的成长是由你乐意进行的不愉快对话的数量来衡量的。

• Speak confidently as if you are right, but listen carefully as if you are wrong.
> 以“我是对的”那样充满自信地讲话，但要以“我是错的”那样去聆听。

• Handy measure: the distance between your fingertips of your outstretched arms at shoulder level is your height.
> 方便的测量方法：你伸开的手臂与肩膀水平的指尖之间的距离就是你的身高。

• The consistency of your endeavors (exercise, companionship, work) is more important than the quantity. Nothing beats small things done every day, which is way more important than what you do occasionally.
> 你努力（锻炼、陪伴、工作）的持续性比数量更重要。没有什么比每天坚持做一点小事更重要的了，这比你偶尔做的大事更重要。

• Making art is not selfish; it’s for the rest of us. If you don’t do your thing, you are cheating us.
> 创造艺术不是自私的；这是给我们其他人的。如果你不做你自己的事，那就是在欺骗我们。

• Never ask a woman if she is pregnant. Let her tell you if she is.
> 永远不要问一位女士是否怀孕了，需要让她自己说出来。

• Three things you need: The ability to not give up something till it works, the ability to give up something that does not work, and the trust in other people to help you distinguish between the two.
> 人需要三项很重要的能力：坚持不放弃直至成功的能力，能够放弃不对的事情的能力，以及能够无条件信任能帮助你鉴别上述两种情况他人的能力。

• When public speaking, pause frequently. Pause before you say something in a new way, pause after you have said something you believe is important, and pause as a relief to let listeners absorb details.
> 公开演讲时，要经常停顿。在你用新的方式说某事之前停顿一下，在你说了你认为重要的事情之后停顿一下，然后刻意制造停顿，让听众吸收细节。

• There is no such thing as being “on time.” You are either late or you are early. Your choice.
> 没有所谓的 "准时 "之说。你要么迟到，要么提前。你别无选择。

• Ask anyone you admire: Their lucky breaks happened on a detour from their main goal. So embrace detours. Life is not a straight line for anyone.
> 问问你钦佩的任何人：堪称幸运的突破和转机，常发生在偏离主要目标的小道上。所以，请拥抱“偏离”。对任何人来说，生活都不是一条直线。

## 31-40
• The best way to get a correct answer on the internet is to post an obviously wrong answer and wait for someone to correct you.
> 在互联网上获得正确答案的最好方法是发布一个明显错误的答案，并等待有人来纠正你。

• You’ll get 10x better results by elevating good behavior rather than punishing bad behavior, especially in children and animals.
> 想要得到10倍好的结果，应该通过表扬好的行为而不是惩罚坏的行为。这在儿童和动物教育身上尤其明显。

• Spend as much time crafting the subject line of an email as the message itself because the subject line is often the only thing people read.
> 尽量用心地修改电子邮件的标题，像对比邮件内容一样，因为这往往是人们唯一会看的内容。

• Don’t wait for the storm to pass; dance in the rain.
> 不要等待暴风雨过去，在雨中起舞吧。

• When checking references for a job applicant, employers may be reluctant or prohibited from saying anything negative, so leave or send a message that says, “Get back to me if you highly recommend this applicant as super great.” If they don’t reply take that as a negative.
> 做求职者的背景调查时，原雇主可能不愿意或被禁止说任何负面的东西，所以，应发送这样的调查信息："如果您强烈认为这位求职者极其出色，请给我回邮件。" 如果他们不回复，就当作是对候选人的否定。

> 接受教育需要掌握的技能有一半是学会哪些东西你可以忽略。

• The advantage of a ridiculously ambitious goal is that it sets the bar very high so even in failure it may be a success measured by the ordinary.
> 一个荒谬的雄心勃勃的目标的优点是它设定了很高的标准，所以即使失败了，也可能已经是常规意义上的成功。

• A great way to understand yourself is to seriously reflect on everything you find irritating in others.
> 了解自己的一个好办法，是认真地思考你发现的他人身上让你讨厌的东西。

• Keep all your things visible in a hotel room, not in drawers, and all gathered into one spot. That way you’ll never leave anything behind. If you need to have something like a charger off to the side, place a couple of other large items next to it, because you are less likely to leave 3 items behind than just one.
> 住酒店时，把所有的东西都放在显眼的地方，不要放在抽屉里，全部集中到一个地方。这样你就不会落下任何东西。如果你需要把充电器之类的东西放在一边，在它旁边放几件其他的大件物品，你落下三样东西的可能性比落下一件要小很多。

# 41-50

It is your duty to work on things that only you can do.
> 当获得一些成功时，你很可能会犯“顶替者综合症”（觉得自己名不副实）。“我在愚弄谁呢？” 但当你创造出只有你--以你独特的才能和经验--才能创造的事物时，那你绝不是顶替者。持续去做只有你才能做出来的事情吧，这是你的使命。

• You will be judged on how well you treat those who can do nothing for you.
> 评判你的标准是你如何对待那些对你没有价值的人。

• You cant reason someone out of a notion that they didn’t reason themselves into.

• At a restaurant do you order what you know is great, or do you try something new? Do you make what you know will sell or try something new? Do you keep dating new folks or try to commit to someone you already met? The optimal balance for exploring new things vs exploiting them once found is: 1/3.
